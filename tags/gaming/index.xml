      <description>Hello folks, here are the steps I had to take to eventually get single GPU passthrough working on Arch Linux with QEMU with an AMD GPU (specifically a PowerColor Red Devil 5700XT 8GB), the problems i had to face and the solutions I found to said problems.
But first, why? Well, dual-booting Windows has always been a bummer to me. Sure, it works wonders in terms of performance for gaming, you&amp;rsquo;re playing on actual Windows without any translation going on, but having to reboot the computer and dedicating a specific amount of space for it always rubbed me the wrong way.</description>
