      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;childhood-and-music&#34;&gt;Childhood and music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to play piano as a child, but
I had difficult learning it to the point I had to use color-coded notes. Later on, around the 7th grade, I picked up the classical guitar, but due to lack of interest by myself
and a not so meaningful selection of songs to learn from my teacher and what not,
I ended up dropping those instruments (I also envied my brother who had an electric
guitar lol).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
